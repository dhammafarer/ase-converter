# RGB color pallette to ASE converter

This script reads an RGB color palette from an input file and encodes it as an .ASE color library for use Adobe Creative Suite programs such as Illustator or In-Design.

The script is written for my personal use only and was also an excercise in functional composition by using the RamdaJS functional library.
The script depends on ramda and ase-utlis packages from npm.

## Usage

Call the script with the RGB input file as the first argument.
Optionally, specify the output file name with the '-n' flag.
